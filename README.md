A context pack that makes your AI host use Trivy with scanning scope, secrets risk, and remediation boundaries visible.

This is an independent AI context resource pack for aquasecurity/trivy: host instructions, prompt preview, evals, pitfalls, and recovery rules you can load into Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Aider, and other AI coding agents.

> This is an independent capability pack. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by aquasecurity/trivy unless explicitly stated.

## Copy / Run / Verify

1. Copy `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` into your AI coding host.
2. Run the first prompt in `01_PROMPT_PREVIEW.md`.
3. Verify behavior with `06_EVALS/smoke_check.md`, then recover with `03_PITFALL_LOG.md` if it fails.

Quick links:
[Start](./AGENTS.md) · [Prompt](./01_PROMPT_PREVIEW.md) · [Evals](./06_EVALS/) · [Pitfalls](./03_PITFALL_LOG.md) · [Manual](./05_HUMAN_MANUAL.md)

## When This Helps

Use this pack when you want an AI coding agent to understand the upstream project context, setup boundaries, common pitfalls, and verification steps before it edits files, installs dependencies, or claims the tool is ready.

## What You Get

- Host instructions for AI coding agents.
- A copyable prompt preview.
- Acceptance checks.
- Pitfall log and recovery steps.
- Boundary and risk card.
- Human reference manual (`05_HUMAN_MANUAL.md`) with architecture, source notes, and failure taxonomy.
- Source attribution and upstream links.

If this pack helps your agent work from evidence instead of guesses, star the repo so future updates are easier to find. Open an issue for bugs, usage questions, or new pitfall reports.

## AGENTS.md for Claude Code and AI Coding Agents

Use `AGENTS.md` for agent hosts that support repository instructions. Use `CLAUDE.md` when Claude Code is the target host.

## aquasecurity/trivy Pitfalls and Recovery

Start with `03_PITFALL_LOG.md` when setup, permissions, runtime behavior, or verification fails.
